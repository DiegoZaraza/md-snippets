Snippets of code to run logic at Akamai Edge Servers

Anybody can contribute a MD Snippet by just sharing 3 files into a github subrepo under https://github.com/akamai/md-snippets.git: 

* A readme text file (just filling a template I am creating right now)
* A screenshot(s) showing how to implement the functionality using the Property Manager UI
* A JSON file showing the code people need to use to implement the functionality via the Akamai CLI “property” module like:

`akamai property update <property> --file <rules.json>`
